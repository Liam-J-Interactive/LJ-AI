First, power off your Chromebook and then press and hold the Esc and Refresh keys simultaneously. While holding those keys, press the Power button. This will boot your Chromebook into recovery mode. Once in recovery mode, press Ctrl + D and then Enter to enable developer mode. A warning message will appear, and you'll need to confirm the action by pressing Ctrl + D again. The Chromebook will then reboot into developer mode, which will require you to dismiss a warning.
